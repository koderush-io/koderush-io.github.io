                            Hello!! I go by Hiram or Mbugua (bo-gu-ah) and I'm the kid behind kode rush. I was born in Kenya and came to states (St. Louis, MO) around 2003. During my young years in the states ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡², I was drawn to computers and would spend countless hours breaking and fixing everything from the hardware to software. This was in the windows 98 and xp days. My curiosity and passion grew as the years progressed and would go on to study computer science at the University of Missouri and now work as a Sr. software developer in the industry.
